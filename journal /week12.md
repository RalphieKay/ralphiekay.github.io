I'm doing this to create a system. To plan ahead, and hit the target:
- inspiration is rarely on demand with me. I should jot them ideas down as they happen
- sugar is weighing me down. Snacks, overeating is hapering my energy by a lot



Realistic goals for the year:




- make some meeting with friends

House work:
- painting a living room
- painting all the doors
- fixing the furnace

The weekend:
